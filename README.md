# C++ header-only FP-Growth library

I am very happy to share you a C++ stand-alone library for FP-Growth algorithm.

As you should know, FP-growth is one of the very efficient method for mining frequent patterns in Data Mining. 
I just want to remind that you can apply this method with transactions as input and it outputs frequent patterns in a FP-tree data structure.

My library is design to allow you to manage with any kind of data type: integer, character, string, ... as it uses template programming. You can use it witout any problem, indeed you just need to define and load transactions and the library will furnish you the FP-tree corresponding to your data.

I've released a v1.0.0 of an application designed in Qt framework to illustrate the use of this library.
Hope it will help you, don't hesitate to signal any issue you encounter using my library.

Thank you for your feedback
Lova
